Control a generative medium using the body as a reference

Using built in Ableton Live’s MIDI FX, I was able to create a probability ensemble that generates audio using a trigger which is a single midi note.
As for the interaction, I use MAX MSP to reference the skeleton key points with POSENET, specifically the nose, right wrist, left wrist and the right hip. The musical reaction can be seen in the performance video in the next slide.
In the Live’s session view you can see the one note midi clips being played. The nose controlled the ambient, the left hand played the piano, the right hand played the plucks and my right hip played the drums. All in all, this created a generative ensemble.
